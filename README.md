# [Child Food Insecurity in the US (2018)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rachel.h7945/viz/ChildFoodInsecurityintheUSA/Presentation)

## Overview
My capstone explores food insecurity among children across the US. I attempt to answer three main questions:

 - What do food insecurity rates among children look like across the US?

 - Is there a correlation between food insecure children and lack of food banks?

 - Are there other well-being factors that relate to childhood food insecurity, either as a result of it or as the cause of it?

Based on these three questions, I provide insight into child food insecurity rates by state and county, food bank density, supermarket access, economic conditions and their relationship to food insecurity and public assistance, and food waste and donation compared to overall surplus. **Through this exploration, I've to the conclusion that food insecurity among children is not a simple problem with a one-size-fits-all solution. It can be associated with many factors, and needs to be addressed in a comprehensive manner, and tailored to location.**

## Motivation
I was inspired to explore data related to food because of my degree in hospitality management and extensive background in that industry. However, I felt myself more drawn to study areas of opportunity to improve social well-being rather than finances.
