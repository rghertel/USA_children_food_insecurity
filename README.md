# Child Food Insecurity in the US (2018)

## Introduction
My project explores food insecurity rates among children and food bank density in the US. It also explores how other factors are correlated to food insecurity rates, including food bank density, as well as economic indicators such as food waste, poverty, and income.

Based on these relationships, I also look deeper into some of the social welfare programs in the states with the highest child food insecurity rates in order to find any areas for improvement.
